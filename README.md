.dotfiles
=========

These are my MacOS / Ubuntu dotfiles. You'll find my config for my favorite tools:
 - bash
 - vim
 - git
 - and more!

Dependencies
------------

 - [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) is a management suite for dotfiles
 - [pack](https://github.com/maralla/pack) is a package manager for vim8

Install
-------

 - `rcup && rcup -v` â€” This second run picks up changes to the `~/.rcrc` file from the first run.
 - `pack install`
